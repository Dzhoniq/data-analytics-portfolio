# Project Overview
In this project, I created a Power BI report for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. 
At the end, you will apply the key concepts of Power BI to create a user-friendly and interactive report so that based on your report,
the CEO of Waggle can make decisions about the future direction of the company.

## Tasks completed
- The CEO is interested in the following questions:
1. Has the average daily step count increased for cats wearing the device as for dogs?
2. Were Lapcat owners as happy with the product as Lapdog owners?
- The CMO would like your report to be branded, including only the colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.
- The product development team has asked you to include other visualizations as you see fit, but they are most interested in demographic comparisons between dogs and cats using Waggle devices, and any information about families that own pets. They would also like you to add slicers so they can filter and explore on their own.

## Database
Download the ZIP folder provided by the Waggle marketing department to design the report. Download the provided starter.pbix containing the Waggle dataset with the model ready.

## Results & Findings 
I created an interactive dashboard with navigation buttons, slicers and visualization for key performance metrics.
