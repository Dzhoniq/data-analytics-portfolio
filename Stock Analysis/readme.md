# Project 8: Stock Analysis 
## Project Overview:
In this project, I did stock analysis using the data from yahoo finance. I got the data from Yahoo Finance and then created a graph to see the historical price. Then to have a better comparison of the selected stocks, I normalized the data. This allowed me to get all the stocks at the same starting point. Then I also checked the risk and return of stocks using the standard deviation and mean of the stock prices.

Data fetching: using yfinance library downloaded financial data
Exploratory data analysis: visualized the stock price
Normalised the data: basing the prices to the intial price
Visualized data to check the actual performance of stocks after normalisation
Calcualted summary statistics - based the standard deviation and mean from a daily basis to a yearly basis
Visualized return and risk of the stocks - using the standard deviation and mean of the stock prices

## Installation and Setup
To work on this project, download the jupyter notebook and follow the script.
If you download jupyter noteboook (ipynb) in the folder, you can see the the description, tasks and step-by-step analysis with the python script. 

## Codes and Resources Used
 - Python was used for this project
 - Python libraries: (Numpy, Pandas, yfinance, Matplotlib)

## Technial skills 
- Python

- Data Preprocessing
-   Data Cleaning
-   Data Validation
-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   Descriptive Statistics
-   Data Visualization to show the normalized data, adn the risk vs. return graph
## Results and Evaluation 
Overall,  it is was found that among the selected stocks, Amazon stock carries higher risk compared to others, but it also offers the highest return. Microsoft stock, on the other hand, exhibits the lowest return as well as the lowest risk. For risk-averse investors, Microsoft stock may be a suitable choice. Among these stock selections, Apple stock falls in the medium risk and return category, with an average return and average risk compared to other stocks. Additionally, by comparing this graph data to the normalized data graph, we can gain a better understanding of the best-performing stock relative to its risk, which is reflected in the volatility of its price and its actual performance. It was also shown that normalized data is better for comparison of different stocks with different price tags.
