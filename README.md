In this repository, I included my Excel, Power BI, and Python data analystics projects. 

[Project 1: Data clening, Data Validation and EDA]()
## Project Overview:
This project is my practical exam from DataCamp **Data Analyst Associate** Certification. 
It's about the sales records analysis of a reatiler of products for pets - PetMind. The are based in the United States. 
PetMind sells products that are mix of luxury items and everyday items. Luxutry items include toys. Everyday items include food. 
The company wants to increase sales by selling more everyday products repeatedly. They have been testing this approach for the last year. They now want a report on how repeat purchases impact sales. So, I will do data cleaning, data validation and then some exploaratiry data analysis to check the performance of their approach.

## Installation and Setup
To work on this project, download CSV file and the instruction file with the tasks under the folder.
If you download jupyter noteboook (ipynb) in the folder, you can see the the description, tasks and step-by-step analysis with the python script. 

## Codes and Resources Used
 - Python was used for this project
 - Python libraries: (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

## Technial skills 
- Python
- Data Acquisition: upload csv file
- Data Preprocessing
-   Data Cleaning
-   Data Validation
-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
-   Data Visualization to support/check my findings with the audience 
## Results and Evaluation 
After the analysis of the sales records, it was concluded that the approach of PetMind to sell more repeat products is coorect. As we can see from the visualization below, the total sales of items with repeat purchase is higher than the items without repeat purchase. The distribution of sales where we look at the sale indiviudally, indicates that the median sales amount is higher for products with no repeat purchase as they have higher price. But the products with repeat purchase had more outliers with high sales which resultred in higher total sales when the products are grouped by repeat purchase criteria.
