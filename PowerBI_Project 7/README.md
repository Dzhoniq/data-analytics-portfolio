# Market Analysis report project

## Project Overview
In this project I created a market intelligence report for a chain store with Power BI. 
I used population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the country has the highest income and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don't know our clients' incomes, but we can predict them by looking at their purchase history and location and comparing it to census data. In addition, we want to analyze our inventory, in particular customer ratings and return rates, and see if there is a correlation between them.

## Tasks completed:
- created a data model and cleaned up the data
- drew conclusions from my analysis
- used visualization to answer questions
- used models to forecast future prospects

## Project description and my role 
An online clothing chain needed help in creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have dropped and they want to win back lost customers. They want to advertise certain products for certain customers in certain places, but don't know who to target. They have three products in mind:
- Shirt: $25
- Sweater: $100
- Leather bag: $1,000
They needed me to do an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each client.
## Questions from the business 
I analyzed the data, created a report and used the visualizations to answer the following questions:
- What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and revenue?
- What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and return rates?
- What linear regression formulas are used to predict customer sales revenue?
- Which customer has the highest income?
- Which product will be advertised the most?
