# Project Overview
In this project, I created a Power BI report for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. 
At the end, you will apply the key concepts of Power BI to create a user-friendly and interactive report so that based on your report,
the CEO of Waggle can make decisions about the future direction of the company.
