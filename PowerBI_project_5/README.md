# Data Modeling Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I created a data model and a Power BI report that aggregates company-wide information for the Seven Sages Brewing Company. 
In the end, I applied the key concepts of Power BI to bring together and centralize data that was previously siled, solving a very common problem that many companies face.

## The tasks that I did:
● used the Get Data functionality
● structure, combine and clean up data
● create a data model by creating relationships between tables
● create measures for the report
● create a Power BI report

# My role as a Data Analyst
I was on the Seven Sages team as a data analyst. My first task is to create a Power BI report. But to do this, I first need to create a data model to make it easier to work with disparate data. 
My report should help the company's CFO quickly review and analyze which beers are selling well and which ones are making the most profit.

## Database
The Seven Sages business team has provided you with several documents. Download ZIP file: Download file
Make sure you can identify each of the listed files:
● Promotional Document. The sales team provided a promotional document listing all of the company's current offerings, ratings, and serving sizes.
● Purchases. Operations Assistant provided purchase data in the form of several Excel spreadsheets.
● Customer Records. The IT department has provided you with customer records. They had to be downloaded separately, but they claim that they are all updated.
● Metrics documentation. The CFO provided documentation of the metrics she collected for sales, costs, and portions (per item).
